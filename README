== Welcome
This is a n-gram based language detector, written in ruby. 

For technical details about language detection, I recommend this paper: http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/iscl/Theses/kranig.pdf

== Installation
sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
sudo gem install feedbackmine-language_detector

== Usage
require 'language_detector'
d = LanguageDetector.new
p d.detect('this text is in English')

== Thanks
Kevin Burton (http://feedblog.org/2005/08/19/ngram-language-categorization-source/ ). I used all the training data in his ngramcat project.
